## üìù Course Description  
This repository contains assignments, projects, and related materials for the **Machine Learning** course offered at Shahid Beheshti University in Fall 2024 for M.Sc. students in Computer Science.  

The course covers both **theoretical foundations** and **practical implementations** of machine learning algorithms, focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, optimization methods, and feature engineering.  

Students are expected to:  
- Understand the mathematical concepts behind ML algorithms.  
- Implement models from scratch and compare them with library implementations.  
- Work with real-world datasets for hands-on experience.  
- Perform model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
- Theoretical parts of assignments are sometimes answered in **English** and sometimes in **Persian**, depending on the nature of the question and convenience of explanation.  
- Practical parts include Python implementations, datasets, and results.  
- If you have any feedback, suggestions, or corrections, feel free to contribute or open an issue in the repository.
