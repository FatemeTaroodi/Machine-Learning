## üìÇ Projects Overview  

This repository contains multiple projects and assignments for the **Machine Learning** course (M.Sc., Shahid Beheshti University, Fall 2024, Instructor: Dr. Farahani).  
The projects cover various topics in supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, as well as data analysis and evaluation techniques.  

**Note on datasets:**  
All datasets used in these projects are from **Kaggle**. Some datasets are large in size, so they are **not uploaded** directly to this repository. The download links are provided inside each project's folder or README.

### **Project 01 ‚Äî News Popularity Prediction & Avocado Price Prediction**  
- **Files:** `project01.ipynb`, `project01.pdf`, `theory01.pdf`, `OnlineNewsPopularity.csv`, `avocado01.csv`  
- **Description:**  
  - **Part 1:** Used the **Online News Popularity** dataset to predict the number of shares for online news articles.  
    - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing.  
    - Implemented Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso.  
    - Tested scaling methods and polynomial features.  
    - Used `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.  
  - **Part 2:** Implemented **Linear Regression with Mean Absolute Error** from scratch and compared results with Scikit-Learn using the **Avocado Price** dataset.

### **Project 02 ‚Äî Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection**  
- **Files:** `project02.ipynb`, `project02.pdf`, `theory02.pdf`, `fraud_oracle.csv`  
- **Description:**  
  - Built multiple classification models to detect fraudulent insurance claims.  
  - Models used: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Voting Classifiers.  
  - Applied stratified cross-validation for performance evaluation.  
  - Checked dataset imbalance and applied over-sampling, under-sampling, and class-weight methods (while avoiding data leakage).

### **Project 03 ‚Äî ECG Heartbeat Clustering Comparison**  
- **Files:** `project03.ipynb`, `project03.pdf`, `theory03.pdf`  
- **Description:**  
  - Used the **ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset** for clustering tasks.  
  - Implemented K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.  
  - Used PCA for dimensionality reduction and re-ran clustering for comparison.  
  - Evaluated using silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and WCSS.  
  - Compared clustering results with ground truth labels to analyze algorithm behavior.

### **Project 04 ‚Äî Snake Game Q-Learning Agent**  
- **Files:** `snake-Qlearning.ipynb`, `project04.pdf`, `SnakeEnvironment.py`  
- **Description:**  
  - Designed an **intelligent agent** to play the Snake Game using **Q-Learning**.  
  - State space: snake position, food position, movement direction.  
  - Reward system: +10 for eating food, -10 for collisions, -1 for unnecessary moves.  
  - Used epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration/exploitation.  
  - Trained and evaluated the agent over multiple episodes, plotting average reward over time.

### **Project 05 ‚Äî Movie Recommender Systems**  
- **Files:** `project05.ipynb`, `project05.pdf`  
- **Description:**  
  - Developed a **Movie Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering techniques.  
  - Compared **user-based** and **item-based** recommendation approaches.  
  - Explored similarity measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson correlation.  
  - Evaluated recommendation quality using precision, recall, and RMSE.
